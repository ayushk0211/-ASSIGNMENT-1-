5. Analysis of an Open Source C Calculator Project
Project Chosen: Simple Calculator in C

Code Structure Overview:

Input Method:
The program prompts the user to input an operator and two operands. It uses scanf() to read the operator as a character and the two numbers as double values.

c

Edit
printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
scanf(" %c", &op);
printf("Enter two operands: ");
scanf("%lf %lf", &n1, &n2);
Control Flow:
A switch-case structure is used to determine the arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator character. Each case executes the corresponding operation and prints the result.

c

Edit
switch(op) {
    case '+': printf("%.1lf", n1 + n2); break;
    case '-': printf("%.1lf", n1 - n2); break;
    case '*': printf("%.1lf", n1 * n2); break;
    case '/': printf("%.1lf", n1 / n2); break;
    default: printf("Error! Operator not correct");
}
